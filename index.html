	<header><h1>Panam Nagar â€“ The Haunting History of an Abandoned City!</h1></header>
	
	<p>Located in Sonargaon, Narayanganj, Bangladesh, Panam Nagar is a mysterious and historic site. <br> Once a prosperous commercial hub of Bengal, it now stands abandoned, echoing tales of its glorious past, oppression, and an eerie history.</p>
	
	<h2>â–   The Rise of Panam Nagar</h2>
	<p>Panam Nagarâ€™s history dates back around 450 years, during the reign of the Baro-Bhuiyan rulers of Bengal. <br>It flourished as a trading city during the Mughal era and became a significant center of commerce and culture under British rule.<br>

    Sonargaon was once the capital of Bengal, and Panam Nagar was its heart of trade. <br> Primarily inhabited by Hindu merchants, this city thrived in exporting fine muslin and other goods to Europe and beyond.</p>

    <h2>â–   Architecture and Urban Design</h2>
    <p>The architecture of Panam Nagar is striking. It consists of around 52 ancient buildings showcasing a mesmerizing blend of Mughal and British colonial styles.<br> The red brick structures still stand today, albeit in a state of decay. Old windows, collapsed roofs, and cracked walls whisper silent tales of the past.</p>

    <h2>â–   The Fall of Panam Nagar</h2>
    <p>Following the partition of India in 1947 and the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, most Hindu merchants fled, leaving the city deserted. <br>By the time of the Liberation War in 1971, Panam Nagar had turned into a ghost town. Many houses were looted and reduced to ruins, and it never regained its former glory.</p>
