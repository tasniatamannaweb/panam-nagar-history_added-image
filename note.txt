Located in Sonargaon, Narayanganj, Bangladesh, Panam Nagar is a mysterious and historic site.
Once a prosperous commercial hub of Bengal, it now stands abandoned, echoing tales of its glorious past, oppression, and an eerie history.

â–  The Rise of Panam Nagar
Panam Nagarâ€™s history dates back around 450 years, during the reign of the Baro-Bhuiyan rulers of Bengal.
It flourished as a trading city during the Mughal era and became a significant center of commerce and culture under British rule.
Sonargaon was once the capital of Bengal, and Panam Nagar was its heart of trade.
Primarily inhabited by Hindu merchants, this city thrived in exporting fine muslin and other goods to Europe and beyond.
